Amiga 3000 SDMAC and WD33C93A register test utility

This is a small utility which can identify the Amiga 3000 SDMAC version
and talk through the SDMAC to read WD33C93A registers.

Updated so this can be built using the [amigadev/crosstools](https://hub.docker.com/r/amigadev/crosstools) Docker container and VSCode
